## Methodology
1 - import libraries and define function to translate words using google cloud translate API

2 - read subtlex-nl and wordlex-nl datasets into a pandas dataframe

3 - merging the 2 wordlex nl datasets (2 are provided on the original site)

4 - rename word column to be lowercase and select df columns that are useful for our work

5 - assign weights to the different wordlex nl word sources, we assign a higher weight to twitter as it would highlight more colloquial language use (which for learning purposes is more useful for our end result)

6 - normalize columns and apply weight multiplier using MinMaxScaler from sklearn

7 - join both wordlex nl and subtlex-nl data using a sum of both relative frequencies to set an order for words

8 - import the subtlex-nl data that details the functions of words the sentences as a code

  * The information about the Part of speech/lemma types explanation for subtlex-nl can be found here: http://crr.ugent.be/archives/362

9 - given that a word can have different functions in a sentence, some words in the part of speech dataset of subtlex-nl are repeated as they might constitute a different PoS depending on the sentence. The first filter was applied to extract *nouns and verbs* first. The reasoning behind this choice is because we want to also include the article for the nouns in Dutch as this is an integral part of learning the language and we're going to find such article by translating the word from Dutch back to english using the english article 'the' along with the translation later, if they differ, we will use a different methodology for finding out the article. The process here is the following:

  * filter nouns and verbs
  * count lemmas to see in how many categories they are, if 2 comes up, theyre classified as verb and noun
  * we extract words that end in 'gaan', 'slaan', 'staan' or 'zijn', as these verbs do not end in 'en'
  * because there are so many words ending in 'en' that are *not* verbs, we need to apply some kind of filter to fairly choose them, so we do one of the following:
  
    * check if it has 'en' as ending **(This is the methodology I'm currently using in v1)**
      * create a sentence as follows 'ik ga *word*' 
      * use spacey's nl_core_news_lg model to check the PoS of such *word* in the sentence (view model here: https://spacy.io/models/nl#nl_core_news_lg)
      * use this tagging to classify the word as verb or noun
  
    
    * if the PoS = Noun, we take it out of the verb list and include in Noun list
  * add this list of verbs and nouns finally separated in a dataframe of words separated from the general list called nw_ww (meaning: naamwoorden_werkwoorden)
